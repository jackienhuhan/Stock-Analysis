# Stock-Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Creating code to help analyze datasets with a simple botton click by making loops within VBA. 

## Results

### Between the two stock performances of 2017 and 2018 there is virtually no changes in dataset as per the charts shown below. The original script took about .67 seconds to run, while the refactored script took only 0.09 seconds. There was a very noticable time difference as the refactored script cut down unnecessary steps which caused the script to run more efficiently. 

## Summary

- What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
Refractoring code makes the existing code more efficent, cutting down run time as well as simplifying unnecessary steps so that the script is easier to read. The disadvantages of refactoring code can accidentally introduce new errors and bugs into the code.

- How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
The script did run faster by refactoring the original script by cutting down about a fourth of the code. There was errors and bugs that ended up popping up a few times that had to be fixed before the script would run smoothly. In the end, the pros could be seen for this script in particular to even out with the cons.
